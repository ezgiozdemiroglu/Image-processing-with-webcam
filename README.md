# Image-processing-with-webcam

We have training and testset in our dataset. 
In our training set, there are 800 photos for happyface, 800 for sad face. On our test back, we have 200 photos for these two. 
First, we imported our libraries and included our data sets.
Then I applied Convolution, Pooling, second convolutional layer, Flattening, Full Connection, Output Layer, respectively. 
Then I made my prediction.
